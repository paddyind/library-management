## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Host ports **3300** (frontend) and **3301** (backend API) available for Docker Compose (see `.env.example` / `LIBRARY_HOST_*`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paddyind/library-management.git
   cd library-management
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root (same directory as `docker-compose.yml`):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials (if using Supabase):
   ```bash
   # Get these from: https://supabase.com/dashboard → Your Project → Settings → API
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   
   # Storage mode: auto (default), supabase, or sqlite
   AUTH_STORAGE=auto
   ```
   
   **Note**: The `.env` file is automatically gitignored and will not be committed to version control.
   
   **About authentication storage modes**:
   - **Auto mode (default)**: Performs health check at startup
     - If Supabase works → Uses Supabase for entire session
     - If Supabase fails → Uses SQLite for entire session
     - **One decision at startup, no repeated checks**
   - **Supabase mode**: Force use of Supabase only (set `AUTH_STORAGE=supabase`)
   - **SQLite mode**: Force use of SQLite only (set `AUTH_STORAGE=sqlite`)
   
   **Important**: Health check is performed once at server startup. If Supabase fails the health check, the system switches to SQLite for the entire session. Restart the server after fixing network issues to retest Supabase.
   
   See [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md) for detailed database setup and management guide.

3. **Initialize databases** (Choose one method)
   
   **Method 1: Single Script (Recommended)**
   
   **Unix/Linux/Mac:**
   ```bash
   cd library-management
   ./data/scripts/setup-database.sh
   ```
   
   **Windows:**
   ```cmd
   cd library-management
   data\scripts\setup-database.bat
   ```
   
   **Or via Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec backend npm run db:init
   ```
   
   This single script:
   - ✅ Checks Docker is running
   - ✅ Runs migrations (creates tables if missing)
   - ✅ Restores from backup if available, OR seeds with demo data
   - ✅ Optionally sets up Supabase if configured
   - ✅ Offers dual-seed for both databases
   
   **For clean start (fresh setup):**
   ```bash
   # Unix/Linux/Mac
   ./data/scripts/setup-database.sh --clean-all --force
   
   # Windows
   data\scripts\setup-database.bat --clean-all --force
   ```
   
   **Method 2: Manual Docker Commands**
   
   ```bash
   # For SQLite: Smart init (migrate + restore/seed)
   docker compose exec backend npm run db:init
   
   # For Supabase: Automated migration (recommended)
   # Add SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD to .env first (get from Supabase Dashboard)
   docker compose exec backend npm run supabase:migrate
   
   # OR manual approach:
   docker compose exec backend npm run supabase:sql
   # Copy SQL from data/backups/supabase-migration-combined.sql
   # Paste in Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run
   
   # Then seed both databases
   docker compose exec backend npm run db:sync
   ```
   
   See [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md) for complete setup guide with all options.

4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. **Access the application** (Docker Compose host ports)
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3300
   - **Backend API**: http://localhost:3301/api
   - **Swagger API Docs**: http://localhost:3301/api-docs

6. **Create your first account**
   - Click "Register" on the welcome page
   - Fill in your details
   - Start browsing and borrowing books!

> **Note**: The application will automatically use SQLite database for user authentication if Supabase is not configured or unavailable. Users are stored persistently in the SQLite database located at `data/library.sqlite`.

---

## 🔒 Route Protection

The application uses a role-based access control system with Higher-Order Components (HOCs) to protect routes.

### Public Routes (No Authentication Required)
- `/` - Home page with book search and catalog
- `/login` - User login
- `/register` - User registration
- `/forgot-password` - Password recovery
- `/help` - Help and documentation
- `/search` - Book search

### Protected Routes (Authentication Required)
All member-only routes automatically redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`:
- `/books` - Book browsing and borrowing (Members)
- `/dashboard` - Personal dashboard (Members)
- `/profile` - Profile management (Members)
- `/settings` - User settings (Members)
- `/transactions` - Borrowing history (Members)
- `/notifications` - User notifications (Members)
- `/reports` - Personal reports (Members)
- `/my-requests` - Book requests (Members)
- `/request-book` - Request new books (Members)

### Admin-Only Routes (Admin Role Required)
These routes require admin role and redirect non-admins to home page:
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard (Admins)
- `/members` - Member management (Admins)

### Authentication Flow
1. Unauthenticated users trying to access protected routes → Redirected to `/login`
2. "Browse without account" links → Redirect to `/` (public home page)
3. After successful login → Redirected to `/dashboard`
4. After logout → Redirected to `/`

### Local Development

Without Docker, the dev servers use **3000** (Next.js) and **4000** (API) on the host. Docker Compose instead publishes **3300** / **3301** so multiple projects can run together (see `observability-platform/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Opens on http://localhost:3000
```

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run start:dev
# API available on http://localhost:4000
```

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Restart a service
docker compose restart frontend

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Rebuild after changes
docker compose up -d --build
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Build Error - "Export default doesn't exist in target module"**
- This was fixed in v1.0.5 by removing duplicate Layout files
- If you encounter this, ensure you have only one Layout.js file
- Run: `docker compose up -d --build`

**Issue: Registration fails with 500 error**
- Ensure subscription tier values match backend enum (FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD)
- Check backend logs: `docker compose logs backend --tail=50`
- Fixed in v1.0.5 with proper enum values

**Issue: Buttons not visible on login/register pages**
- This was a Tailwind CSS configuration issue (fixed in v1.0.5)
- Ensure tailwind.config.js has correct content paths
- Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R

**Issue: Cannot access the application**
```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker compose ps

# Check logs for errors
docker compose logs

# Restart containers
docker compose restart
```

**Issue: "Invalid credentials" on login**
- Register a new account to get started
- Check backend is running: `docker compose logs backend`
- If you see "Member with ID 'user-X' not found", log out and log in again (old session token)

**Issue: Changes not reflecting**
- Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Rebuild containers: `docker compose up -d --build`

**Issue: Members page accessible without login**
- Fixed in v1.0.5 with `withAdminAuth` HOC
- Only admin users can access /members page now

## 🗄️ Database Seed

The application comes with a seed script that supports both **Supabase** and **SQLite** databases:

**Run the seed script:**
```bash
# In Docker (will auto-detect Supabase or SQLite based on AUTH_STORAGE)
docker compose exec backend npm run seed

# Force SQLite mode
AUTH_STORAGE=sqlite docker compose exec backend npm run seed

# Force Supabase mode
AUTH_STORAGE=supabase docker compose exec backend npm run seed
```

**Seeded Data Includes:**
- 3 Demo Users:
  - `demo_admin@library.com` (Admin role) - Password: `password`
  - `demo_librarian@library.com` (Librarian role) - Password: `password`
  - `demo_member@library.com` (Member role) - Password: `password`
- 8 Sample Books (The Great Gatsby, To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, Pride and Prejudice, The Catcher in the Rye, The Hobbit, Harry Potter, The Da Vinci Code)
- 3 Groups (Administrators, Librarians, Members) with user-group relationships

**Note:** The seed script automatically detects which database to use based on:
- `AUTH_STORAGE` environment variable (`auto`, `sqlite`, or `supabase`)
- Availability of Supabase credentials (if `auto` mode)

If Supabase is not configured, it will automatically seed SQLite instead.

## 💾 Database Backup Best Practices

### Backup Strategy

**Location**: Backups are stored in `backend/backups/` directory:
- `backend/backups/supabase/` - Supabase backups
- `backend/backups/sqlite/` - SQLite backups

**Demo Users**: Demo users (`demo_admin@library.com`, etc.) are **excluded from backups** automatically. They can be recreated via seeding, so there's no need to backup them.

**Real Users**: Only real user accounts (where `is_demo = false`) are included in backups to protect actual user data.

### Creating Backups

```bash
# Backup current database (auto-detects storage type)
docker compose exec backend npm run db:backup

# Backup creates timestamped JSON file:
# backend/backups/supabase/supabase-backup-2025-10-31T12-00-00-000Z.json
# backend/backups/sqlite/sqlite-backup-2025-10-31T12-00-00-000Z.json
```

### Restoring from Backup

```bash
# List available backups
ls backend/backups/supabase/
ls backend/backups/sqlite/

# Restore from specific backup (use --confirm flag)
docker compose exec backend npm run db:restore backend/backups/sqlite/sqlite-backup-*.json --confirm
```

### Scrap and Recreate Workflow

For complete database reset with data restoration:

```bash
# 1. Create backup first (always!)
docker compose exec backend npm run db:backup

# 2. Run reset (this will: backup → migrate → restore)
docker compose exec backend npm run db:reset

# OR manually:
# docker compose exec backend npm run db:migrate  # Recreate schema
# docker compose exec backend npm run db:restore <backup-file> --confirm  # Restore data
```

### Best Practices

1. **Always backup before migrations or major changes**
2. **Regular backups**: Schedule daily/weekly backups for production
3. **Backup verification**: Test restore process periodically
4. **Version control**: Keep backup files organized with timestamps
5. **Demo vs Real**: Demo users are automatically excluded - they're recreated on seed

### What Gets Backed Up

- ✅ **Real users** (is_demo = false) - Protected user accounts
- ✅ **Books** - All book catalog data
- ✅ **Groups** - User groups and permissions
- ✅ **Transactions** - Borrowing history
- ✅ **Reservations** - Book reservations
- ✅ **Notifications** - User notifications

- ❌ **Demo users** (is_demo = true) - Excluded (can be recreated)

**See**: [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md) for complete schema documentation.

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Sanity Test Suite

The application includes a basic sanity test suite to verify core functionality:

**Run tests in Docker:**
```bash
docker compose exec backend npm run test:sanity
# OR
docker compose exec backend node scripts/sanity-test.js
```

**Run tests locally (if backend is running):**
```bash
cd backend
npm run test:sanity
# OR
node scripts/sanity-test.js
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ API connectivity and health
- ✅ Database connectivity (SQLite/Supabase)
- ✅ Public endpoints (books)
- ✅ Authentication flow (register/login)
- ✅ Protected endpoints (profile)
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations (create/get books)
- ✅ Search functionality

**Test results:**
- Tests pass: Exit code 0
- Tests fail: Exit code 1 with detailed error messages

The test suite is designed to be run as part of CI/CD pipelines or manually after deployments.

## 🎨 Technology Decisions

### Why Tailwind CSS?
The project uses **Tailwind CSS** (not Bootstrap) for several reasons:
- ✅ Smaller bundle size (~10-20KB vs 150KB+)
- ✅ Better for future mobile app development (React Native via nativewind)
- ✅ Utility-first approach for faster development
- ✅ Highly customizable without overriding defaults
- ✅ Better tree-shaking and purging of unused styles

### Current State
- All pages are fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Consistent design system with reusable components
- Production-ready styling with no known issues
